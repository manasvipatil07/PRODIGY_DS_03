Precision:

The precision for class 0 (customers who did not purchase) is high, indicating that when the model predicts a customer will not purchase, it is correct about 91% of the time.
The precision for class 1 (customers who purchased) is relatively low at around 45%, meaning that when the model predicts a customer will purchase, it is correct only about 45% of the time.
Recall:

The recall for class 0 is also high, indicating that the model correctly identifies about 95% of the customers who did not purchase.
The recall for class 1 is lower at around 31%, indicating that the model only correctly identifies about 31% of the customers who actually purchased.
F1-score:

The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is higher for class 0 compared to class 1, suggesting better overall performance in predicting customers who did not purchase.
Accuracy:

The overall accuracy of the model is approximately 87%, indicating that the model correctly predicts whether a customer will purchase or not about 87% of the time.
